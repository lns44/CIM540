My Final Project: Florida Wildlife
May-2019, Lauren Stolz
My Final

# DESCRIPTION

This is an interactive site where the user can click on different species icons to learn their name, find out if they are invasive or endangered, see a photo of them in real life and hear what sound they make!

I made this project for educational purposes. The aim is to help teach people both young and old about Florida's rich wildlife. Its purpose also includes educating users about the endangered and invasive species within the state of Florida.

It is coded using p5 and will be displayed on primarily laptops for in class interactive learning, or potentially for students wanting to learn about the Florida wildlife before going on a trip to the Everglades!
