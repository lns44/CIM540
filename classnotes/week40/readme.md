My Final Project: Florida Wildlife
May-2019, Lauren Stolz
My Final

# DESCRIPTION

This is an interactive site where the user can click on different species to learn their name, see a video of them in real life and find out if they are invasive or endangered! There is also a feature that allows the user to have either bubbles or leaves fall from the top of the screen, mimicking the two primary habitats of the species listed.

I made this project for educational purposes. Its aim is to help teach people (young and old) about Florida's rich wildlife.

It is coded using p5 and will be displayed on primarily laptops for in class interactive learning, or if out on a field trip.
